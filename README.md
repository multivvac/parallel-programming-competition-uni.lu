# üèÜ 1st Parallel Programming Competition @uni.lu

Welcome to the **1st Parallel Programming Competition** ‚Äî we are excited to have you here! üéâ

This competition is team-based: each team consists of 2‚Äì3 participants. Once the contest starts, you will:

1. Understand the problem statement,
2. Design and implement an algorithm,
3. Parallelize and optimize it,
4. Benchmark your solution, and
5. Submit your results before the deadline(try you best to reach higher level!).

Each team will be given **exclusive access to one node** of the [Iris cluster](https://hpc-docs.uni.lu/systems/iris/compute/) featuring:

* Dual Intel Xeon Skylake CPUs (28 cores)
* 4√ó NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs (16GB each)
* 768 GB RAM

## Rules & Format

* Teams: **2‚Äì3 members**.
* Duration: **5 hours**.
* Submissions:
  * Once the competition officially begins, you will see all related information about submissions in `problems/` folder in current directory.
* Ranking:

  * **Level** represents milestones achieved in solving the challenge.
  * Within the same level, the team with the **shorter runtime** ranks higher.
* Allowed languages: C, C++, or CUDA (you may combine).

## How to Participate

1. Clone this repository to your team‚Äôs workspace on the Iris node.
2. Navigate to the `problems/` folder and read the problem statement.
3. Implement your solution and run benchmarks on the Iris node.
4. Submit your code and results.

## Submission Guidelines

TBA

## Scoring & Leaderboard

* Teams are ranked primarily by **level** (how complete the solution is).
* For teams on the same level, ranking is decided by **runtime** (lower is better).
* The leaderboard will be updated live on the [competition website](https://multivvac.github.io/parallel-programming-competition-uni.lu/) during the contest.
